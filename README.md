About the Project
The dashboard, created using the dataset from the Maven Hospital Challenge, provides a comprehensive overview of patient admissions and hospital activities. 
It features a line chart that depicts the number of patients admitted each year, revealing trends in admission rates over time. 
A city filter is available to identify the locations with the highest patient counts, offering insights into geographical distribution. 
The dashboard also highlights the top five reasons for patient admissions, which can be used to refine visualizations. 
Additionally, it shows that the average length of stay in the hospital is 7.27 hours. 
It details the number of covered procedures 48,000 between 2011 to 2022 and provides a breakdown of patient encounters by gender and month. 
The bar graph displays various encounter classes, such as urgent care, ambulatory, and emergency, and compares these with the total claim costs. 
Overall, the dashboard integrates these elements and the business needs were fulfilled by offering a detailed analysis of patient admissions and hospital services.
